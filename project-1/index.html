    <p>   This website is dedicated to the study and cataloging of soup. You may wonder as to my qualifications for this role. I assure you that I am a simple soup enjoyer like you, however someone had to do it.
        Soup can fufil different roles in different peoples lives. It can be an easy meal when you are too tired to cook dinner. Some can be a nice thing for a diet for some. It can be the meal prep done at the beginning of the week for others. To some it may even be peak food.
        Whatever food may mean to you, it must be important for you to end up on a website dedicated entirely to soup. Or you are grading me for my proficiency in website creation. That could also be the case.
