        Vegetable based soups are a simple beast. Vegetable stock can be made from simply boiling vegetables with a bit of water to form a liquid delight.  Vegetable based soups will often lack contents with meat, and can offer a more light side dish as apposed to a hearty main dish in a meal that other soup types can occupy.

        Vegetable soups also include many niche types, such as the famous tomato soup, which has a startling thick red broth, or lintel soup, which congeals into a  thick sludge packed with protein and nutrients.
