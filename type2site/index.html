    <h1><strong>No More UFOs</strong></h1>
    <p>Every artist has UFOs or “UnFinished Objects” floating around. It can be easy to finish projects for others, wether it be an assignment, commission or for a job, but making art for yourself can be difficult. This website seeks to address several of the reasons this may be, and offer up a variety of solutions.</p>
</div>
    <div class="righthead">
    <h2><strong>Too Many Ideas!</strong></h2>
    <p>    Sometimes when ideas are left to ferment too long they multiply rather than develop. The volume of ideas can lead to a sort of creative paralysis. For this, its best to make a plan of action: </p>
    <h3><strong>Make a List of Priorities</strong></h3>
    <p>Make a list of projects you would like to complete in the near future. If you tend to complete projects slowly, make a list for the next couple of months. If you work quick or are finishing smaller projects, try making a list for just that month. You may find it less intimidating if you can break large projects into smaller steps. For example, you could break down the task “finished drawing” into steps like sketching, line art or flat colors, shading ect.</p>
</div>
    <div class="lefthead">
    <h1><strong>Not Enough Time</strong></h1>
    <p>    If you really want to complete the project, there will be ways to find time to work on it. You may be able to find time in lunch breaks or on days off. For schedule that allow, I would recommend setting aside 15 minutes everyday to work on a project. some mediums may require more time to make progress, and some schedules don’t allow for that, but the gist is to have a set time that is just for project time.</p>
</div>
    <div class="righthead">
    <h2><strong>How Do I Do it?</strong></h2>
    <p>    This is a matter of making yourself sit down and research. Google and youtube guides are your friend here.</p>
    <h3><strong>Make it fun!</strong></h3>
    <p>    When researching, it can be a good idea to make note taking fun. For me, I found a pretty notebook and pens that were fun to write with.</p> 
    <p>It can also help to get a friend or family memeber to listen to you explaining the process or research and have them ask questions to help you clarify things and get more specific. Getting research done first can make later steps go much smoother.</p>
</div>
    <div class="lefthead">
    <h1><strong>No Motivation</strong></h1>
    <p>Even with times blocked out for work time it can be hard to motivate yourself to use it. This is different for everyone, but I have two ways that can be effective.</p>
    <p>
    One way is that you have other people help hold you accountable. See if you can work around other artists at the same time, such as in a studio setting. Jump into a voice call with your friends and have them watch your progress. 
    The final method is to get yourself into a “productive” mood. Try completing chores to get yourself in a productive mood. When you finish the chores, immediately sit down to work. You may be able to transfer that energy into a new task.
    </p>

<div class="righthead">
    <h2><strong>Art Block</strong></h2>
    <p>    Don’t get this confused with a lack of motivation. Art block is when you sit dawn and draw, but fail to make any meaningful progress. You struggle to imagine what you want in your head or you have a disconnect causing the translation from head to page to be impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a difficult and deeply personal problem to solve. You may want to take a break and do some creative exercises. Another way that helps me is to get excited about my project again. 
      </p>
      <h3><strong>Get Excited and inspired again!</strong></h3>
      <p>  One way is to spend time on Pintrest and getting yourself re-jazzed on your idea. This can be a double edged sword however, and you can quickly get off task. 
      </p>
        <p>
        Another method I use is to take a walk. Spend the first half of the walk clearing your mind of distractions. On the way back, begin to think about your project. By the end of the walk you are hopefully in a mindset that can work on your project. </p>
</div>
<div class="righthead">
    <h1><strong>The Point of No Return</strong></h1>
    <p>    Sometimes, you feel like there is no path of progress. If other steps don’t help, it may be time to lay this project to rest and start anew. Don’t feel discouraged. Artwork is a endeavor ending cycle of progress with intermittent success. Your time was never wasted, you were simply learning.</p>
       <p> You should complete a post mortem autopsy no matter how far along the piece is. At what step did you make a crucial mistake. Could you revert to that step and try again? For example, you are doing a marker drawing and get very far into the development of colors, but you now know that the pose is too static and looks wrong. Take out some tracing paper and see if you can’t fix it up.</p>
