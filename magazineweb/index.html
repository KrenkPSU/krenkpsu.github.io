    <title>What is Front-Page News?</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>
        Anything on earth is news because anything on earth can get into the newspaper—into some sort of newspaper. On page 23 of today's New York Herald Tribune, there is a small headline: "Excessive Smoking Held on Rise Among Women—and a hundred or so words of the following type from Skytop, Pa., goes on to say that Dr. Alexander M. Campbell, of Grand Rapids, Mich., believes more women, every day, are smoking too much.
    </p>
    <p>There is no definition of news which would really include an item of that sort, because it is not news at all. Everybody knows, without hearing it from the papers, that a lot of women smoke too many cigarettes for their own good, and the solemn statement of this generally accepted fact, even from the lips of a medico, neither informs us of something fresh nor clarifies for us an old puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>As you begin to scan through your morning paper, you will quickly realize that there is a very clear division among the various sorts of things that the newspaper prints. News, of course. I am coming back to that. But sandwiched in with the news are items of several very distinct categories. To begin with, there are the trifles which he used to call human interest stories. That description is out of favor now, because it sounds banal and unprofessional, but the pieces remain human interest stories nevertheless. These pieces, again, fall into two classes:
    </p>
    <p>There is the brief stick of type, generally boxed in with rules, like "13 Sleep in Straw Pile, Fire Kills All but 13th — and eight lines of print, dated Prague, Czechoslovakia, saying that twelve out of thirteen unemployed men met death when a stable took fire. A story of that sort is used because of the head that can be put on it. The death of twelve unemployed Czechs, near Prague, is not interesting in America. Hundreds of Czechs die every day and their passing is not noted by our journals. But there was a play at thirteen. Was it an unlucky number, the baleful total causing the fire in the first place? Was it a lucky number, seeing that the thirteenth man escaped? Of course, the newspaper does not discuss this problem at all. But it poses a problem for the superstitious to worry about.
    </p>
    <p>The second type of human interest story is the amusing bit of trivia, dug out of the grist and handed over to the budding short-story writer of the staff for the exercise of his virtuosity. Frank Ward O'Malley, Frank Sullivan, and Joseph Van Raalte are the deans of this school. But there are enough anonymous rewrite men still practicing to keep the tradition alive. 1 glance at an example: “Carrousel Man, Dizzy, Grabs for $60 Brass Ring”.
    </p>
    <p>Following this trick head is nearly a column of careful and tremendously detailed writing about the utterly unimportant predicament of a carnival man.
    </p>
    <p>These things, as I have said, are not news at all. Neither are hundreds of little stories such as the one about women smoking cigarettes, which fall into their own category: the category of idle fillers, generally designed to get the name of some little Society in the paper, or the name of some climbing individual.
    </p>
    <p>Yet, they all serve their purpose. Along with the comic strips, the medical advice, the bedtime stories, the space given to the columnists and reviewers, they draw up the picture of the past twenty-four hours. They hold, in all the truth of a cliché, the mirror up to life: what people are doing, and saying, laughing at and crying about.
    </p>
    <p>News? It falls into five main sections: Government and Politics, Business, Sports, the Progress of Science, and Disaster.
    </p>
    <p>And the greatest of these, to the front page and the reader and the circulation manager, is Disaster. I include in that one word War, Crime, Shipwreck, Sudden Death in all its manifestations; in short, the melodrama of human existence.
    </p>
    <p>War gets the call any time at all—war in any spot of the globe. But war, unless our own brave lads are engaged, is melodrama in the abstract, and it can he shoved aside at any moment—its front-page space reduced or taken away altogether—for melodrama in the concrete: a savage or sad or shocking event in our own community, among our own people. That is partly because wars are, in the vernacular, running stories. They can be counted upon, day after day, to provide the headlines if local melodrama fails to provide them. Most local melodramas peter out in a brief time: two days or three, or even a week. Then back to its accustomed place, columns six. seven and eight, three-line heads with plenty of banks, comes good old war.
    </p>
    <p>I ask you to remember the newspaper accounts of the death of Will Rogers, the shooting of Huey Long. In both instances, the preparations for the war between Italy and Ethiopia dropped back to page two and page three and page four. They were tremendous news stories because the victims in each case were more intimate to us than the man in the next block. We knew them by their first names, all of us. though we had perhaps never seen them. We knew more about their whims, virtues, and shortcomings than we might know even about some blood relative whom we had not seen for a long while. They were acquaintances of the general public, and the melodramatic circumstances of their passing made all of us want to read every possible word: made all of us want to put together in our imaginations the smallest details of the final, crashing moments.
    </p>
    <p>"These events, then, were of the very essence of news. Too much could not be printed. The obituary notices of the victims could not be too long for the public appetite.
    </p>
    <p>But both stories came to a quick end. They simply could not survive for more than two or three days, even when the editors and reporters strove manfully to stretch them out with long accounts of the funerals, with hastily contrived biographies and with constant harrying of the surviving relatives. Both stories, by their very unexpectedness and instant finality, were of that explosive nature which means complete disappearance within a few editions.
    </p>
    <h1>         THE WAR CAME BACK TO ITS OLD PLACE ON PAGE 1. IT COULD BE PUT OFF AGAIN, QUICKLY ENOUGH. LET ANOTHER MONO CASTLE BURN, OR A TITANIC GO DOWN. 
    </h1>
    <p>Ship disasters are perhaps the highest melodrama which the news of the world provides—higher, even, than war, for war goes on so long that it loses the force of unity, of crushing impact, and becomes in the columns of the press even as in the trenches, a campaign of attrition.
    </p>
    <p>Shipwreck, like war, is a struggle. But it is a struggle with the end always in sight. The term of the battle is set, like the term of a prize fight. At the end of a given time, in the near future, somebody or something is bound to win. Will the elements strike down the survivors? W ill the ship hold its own? Or the little boats in which the survivors are floating?
    </p>
    <p>Disaster at sea becomes then, I think, the prime catastrophe for the press, which displays its greatest resources, its finest talents, when catastrophe is afoot.
    </p>
    <p>Murder, individual catastrophe, is news in direct proportion to two governing elements: How prominent in public celebrity is the victim? and how brutal, how mysterious the crime? Dozens of murders are routine news—and one-day reports in the hack pages.
    </p>
    <p>We have had two colossal murders in my time as a newspaperman: In the Hall-Mills case in New Jersey, and the kidnaping and murder of Charles Lindbergh, Jr.
    </p>
    <p>The Hall-Mills case came on a little slowly. Its first appearance in the press made it seem just another crime of passion. But within a very few hours it was apparent that here was one of those fabulous crimes out of the story books, for strange and ill assorted people were concerned, and mystery hung like a pall over the scene.
    </p>
    <p>The death of the preacher and the choir-singer was front page news for months. Much of that news was deliberately invented, to keep the story alive. Reportorial invention is inevitable whenever a big story threatens to sag of inertia, but I have never seen it go to such lengths of ingenuity as in the Hall-Mills case.
    </p>
    <p>There was no news one day, and so a reporter planted a blood) knife, which he proceeded to lead a detective toward. "Startling Discovery Made", "Murder Knife Found Near Scene". It was good for twenty-four hours, and then forgotten. Mysterious women in black moved in and out of the reporters imaginations. Handkerchiefs were planted and found. Dark tales were made up to account for a cot and a few dead flowers found in the old Phillips farm house.
    </p>
    <p>But the story finally frayed out. There was no more to tell, and the inventiveness of the reporters was exhausted. The HallMills case dropped out of the papers. People forgot about it.
    </p>
    <p>Yet it was too good a thing to let die.
        Months and months after the last line had been written, an editor decided to revive the whole thing, lie put a sleuth reporter to work, and soon he was able to shatter the morning of the city with a blunt accusation of Mrs. Hall. Her portrait occupied the whole front page of the editor's tabloid, with the simple caption, "Murderess".
    </p>
    <p>The trial came on. The newspaper forced the trial. That was two-penny-a-copy meat for every other paper in the East, and nobody wanted to print less than a full stenographic transcript of the testimony. Newspaper circulations, all of them, went up by thousands in that time. Of course Mrs. Hall was acquitted. Of course the editor settled on his libel suit—for $300,000. But there was, at the very least, a $300,000 boost in the circulation of New York City papers, and so the money was not ill-spent, regardless of the grief which was ruthlessly loaded upon the shoulders of Mrs. Hall.
    </p>
    <p>The Lindbergh case was, of course, the greatest story which ever broke in America. It shared, with the sinking of the Titanic and the Declaration of War in 1917, the distinction of occupying the entire front page of all the newspapers in New York. (Please understand that I am speaking professionally, now. With all my sympathy for victims, I want to talk about news in the newspapers.) Furthermore, it shared this complete domination of the first page on two occasions: first, the kidnaping itself: second, the capture of Hauptmann.
    </p>
    <p>News cannot be greater than either of these three examples: The Declaration of War by our own country; a murder mystery with every conceivable element of the storybook pattern, including mystery, humor, insanity, illicit love, and association with the church; the kidnaping and murder of a child universally known, with the subsequent capture and conviction of the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>For these are the ultimate in catastrophe, in disaster which we can dramatize in our own hearts, in events which make us tremble, a little, when we go to bed at night.
    </p>
    <p>Even so, there are two other departments of the news which make more circulation for newspapers than the front page: which means that they interest more people than the front page.
    </p>
    <p>Let any American big-city daily drop its sports department; let any such paper drop its stock-market tables, and it will be ruined. For these, too, are news, and news which strikes at the very hearts of the readers. It strikes at the hobbies and the pocket-books of millions of our citizens.
    </p>
    <p>One time I was on the old Evening World as a re-write man. We were running a cartoon feature on the sporting page called Joe and Asbestos. It was drawn by Ken Kling and it provided a daily tip on the races. Mr. Kling, aware of the great popularity of his feature, demanded more money. He pointed out that his feature had made money for everybody who followed it. and the assumption was that thousands of readers were, indeed, following it. The Evening World was moving toward its ultimate debacle and refused to pay more money. Joe and Asbestos disappeared from the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>The second day thereafter, the telephone girls were plunged into a nightmare. All the world, it seemed, was demanding Joe and Asbestos. The circulation of the paper went off 5,000—-then 10.000—then 20,000. That was important for a newspaper with less than 400,000 altogether. Joe and Asbestos came back in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>So what is news? It is, in the final analysis, something to make people buy newspapers. They will buy newspapers in order to harrow their souls with disaster, reading all the details, and the more lugubrious the better. They will buy newspapers for the entertainment provided by the columnists and feature people. They will buy newspapers to find out what is happening in sports and what is probably not happening in the stock market.
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes, as it appears, they will buy newspapers to read front page headlines saying: "Mellen Faces Fight to Hold County Reins" and "Constitutional Change Beaten in Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>But only the headlines.
